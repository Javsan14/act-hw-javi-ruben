## Introduction
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulates the movement of atoms based on their initial positions and velocities. In this project, we will develop a molecular dynamics program to illustrate key concepts in MD simulations. Our program will read force eld parameters and the initial positions of atoms from an input file. After each small displacement of atoms according to their velocities, the updated coordinates will be saved to an output file, enabling the creation of a video animation with an external tool.

## Features
- Simple MD simulations
- Outputs to xyz format
